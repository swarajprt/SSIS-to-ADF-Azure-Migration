üéØ Why Azure Data Factory (ADF)?

1. SSIS is on-premises, memory-heavy, tightly coupled with SQL Server.
2. ADF is cloud-native, scalable, event-driven, and integrates with a wide Azure ecosystem.
3. ADF focuses on orchestration, not transformation-only ‚Äî transformations offloaded to services like Mapping Data Flows, Azure SQL, or Databricks.

| SSIS Feature             | ADF/Azure Equivalent                                 | Note / Tip                 |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Control Flow             | ADF Pipelines (If, ForEach, Until, Execute Pipeline) | Orchestration              |
| Data Flow Task           | Mapping Data Flow                                    | Use for ETL logic          |
| Lookup (Full Cache etc.) | Broadcast Join in Data Flow                          | No partial cache           |
| Script Task              | Azure Function / Synapse / Python in Databricks      | Use for logic-heavy tasks  |

| Execute SQL Task         | Stored Procedure Activity / Script Activity          | Use parameters             |
| Variables & Parameters   | Pipeline Variables / Parameters                      | Key for reusability        |
| Conditional Split        | Data Flow Conditional Split                          | Same concept               |
| Multicast                | Use multiple outputs in ADF activities               | Direct mapping             |

| CI/CD (SSISDB Deploy)    | ARM Templates + Git Integration + Azure DevOps       | CI/CD-ready                |


| üö® Real-World Gaps & Smart Workarounds |
|----------------------------------------|
| Missing in ADF                         | Workaround                                  | Best Practice
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Partial Cache Lookup                   | Not available                               | Use SQL joins or prepare small ref tables |
| Script Logic                           | Azure Function, Synapse script, Databricks  | Modular, version-controlled               |
| Event Handlers (SSIS)                  | Event Grid + Logic App / Azure Function     | Modern, reactive architecture             |
| Row-by-row processing                  | Use Spark in Mapping Data Flow or Notebooks | Avoid row-by-row unless critical          |



| üß© The Real Story: Microsoft Backs Both ‚Äî But for Good Reason |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| üõ†Ô∏è SSIS                                                      | ‚òÅÔ∏è Azure Data Factory (ADF)                                 |
| Been around since 2005 ‚Äî a rock-solid ETL tool                | Born in the cloud ‚Äî built for ELT, orchestration, and scale |
| Feature-packed with powerful in-memory processing             | Serverless, scalable, and modular                           |
| Great for row-by-row, on-prem transformations                 | Excels with big data and modern cloud stacks                |
| Integrates tightly with on-prem SQL Server                    | Tailored for hybrid and cloud-native workloads              |
| License-based model                                           | Pay-as-you-go pricing                                       |



| ü§î So Why Does Microsoft Still Support Both?                                                                                                                     |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The short answer: because they have to.                                                                                                                          |
| SSIS has a huge install base ‚Äî and big enterprises can‚Äôt just flip a switch and move everything to the cloud overnight.                                          |
| ADF is the future ‚Äî optimized for cloud workloads like ADLS Gen2, Synapse, and Databricks.                                                                       |
| Microsoft bridges the gap with SSIS Integration Runtime (IR) inside ADF ‚Äî so legacy packages can still run in the cloud while teams modernize at their own pace. |



| üí∏ The Cost Reality: Yes, It Adds Up                                                                                        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| You‚Äôre not imagining things ‚Äî using both can get pricey:                                                                    |
| SSIS on-prem = license fees + hardware + maintenance                                                                        |
| ADF (or ADF + SSIS IR) = pay-per-use + cloud infra + support costs                                                          |
| And during migration? Teams often run both in parallel ‚Äî effectively doubling their ETL costs until the transition is done. |


| üß† What Smart Teams Do: Phased Transition Strategy                          |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| üîπ Phase 1: Hybrid Setup                                                    |
| Keep existing SSIS packages running ‚Äî either on-prem or via SSIS IR in ADF. |
| Begin building new ETL workloads in ADF when possible.   
|
| üîπ Phase 2: Gradual Modernization                                           |
| Start rebuilding simple SSIS logic in ADF using:                            |
| Pipelines + Mapping Data Flows                                              |
| Azure Functions (for code/script logic)                                     |
| Synapse SQL Pools for data transformations                                  |
| Migrate gradually ‚Äî don‚Äôt force it all at once.   
|
| üîπ Phase 3: Go Full Cloud                                                   |
| Once legacy loads are retired, drop SSIS entirely.                          |
| Use ADF + Databricks + Synapse to scale ETL across your cloud stack.        |
